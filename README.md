# Customer acquisition for a digital newspaper

This project was made for a job interview for Grupo RBS where I developed a model to classify some users of a digital newspaper to discover if they would become subscribers or not, based in use and demographic data. This project cover all the steps of a data science project, from data cleaning to the tuning of model. And yes, I got the job.

The project is structured in 3 steps:
- [Proposal (pt-br)](https://github.com/FilippoPetroli/case_aquisicao/blob/master/proposta.md) - Document with a solution proposal.
- [Jupyter Notebook (pt-br)](https://github.com/FilippoPetroli/case_aquisicao/blob/master/modelo.ipynb) - The development of model. 
- [Report (pt-br)](https://github.com/FilippoPetroli/case_aquisicao/blob/master/report.pdf) - Report with the documentation of development and results of model.
